This repo adds an architecture overview of the steps described in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-example-s3.html. That example project can be regarded as

* How to use SAM to deploy an infrastructure
* How to use "sam local" to simplify development and by deploying a Lambda function to a locally running Docker container
* How to create a simple showcase for how Amazon Rekognition performs image recognition
* How to program Lambda to write to a DynamoDB table
